arma-scripts
============

Growing collection of sqf scripts, optimized for Arma 3. Check out my new dynamic world generator project @
https://github.com/devynspencer/valkyrie.Altis

Please note that I am not the author of most of these. I do however modify most new scripts things extensively to ensure they integrate well with my other scripts.

I've only recently started writing sqf scripts for Arma, and while it's been a fairly easy process, I've had trouble really hitting the ground running. I feel this could be improved for others with a few *quality* resources, and therefore I will be including a series of tutorial posts on my [blog](http://devynspencer.github.io).

As I use community scripts in my projects, I will post the cleaned up code here, along with documentation explaining the use of each script along with examples.
